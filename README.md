# Spectacle
Spectacle is a presentaion software primarily for churches, but it aims to be general purpose. It's most similar to software like [openlp](https://openlp.org/), [easyworship](https://www.easyworship.com/) and [freeshow](https://freeshow.app/)


### But Why
Well I'm your classic linux fan boy, so easyworship was already out of the picture for me, the other two openlp and freeshow are quite tasking for my pc as they are written in python and javascript respectively. They are still pretty good, in fact I've been using freeshow during the development of spectacle.

### The Solution? [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
That's right, spectacle is written in rust using the [tauri](https://tauri.app/) toolkit with [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) as the UI layer. Spectacle aims to be a lightweight but performant presentation software that is packed with all the features you need.

### Note
Spectacle is still under heavy development and is lacking many key features, as well as Windows and Mac installers. But if you're on a Linux machine and want to test it out, there are rpm and deb installers in the files directory.
